In this app, you can guess the color which was drown randomly and written in the RGB format.
6 buttons are showing up, and you have to click button with the color that matches color shown as a text in RGB.
If you guess correctly, next 6 buttons are generating dynamically as well as a color in text above, but if you don't, you can try as much as you want
